there is a number guessing game
this game will require a function, some variables and properties
you enter a number to see if it matches the correct number
create a function called game
create variables to store information
the logic is that there is a range of numbers already stored and the user enters a number which will be compared with those range of numbers 
so one variable will have the lowest number in the range and another variable will have the highest number in the range
the third variable will have the user's number 
a getguess method will be created inside the game function that asks the user to enter a number and a prompt method as well will be used to store that number
a previous guess variable is created and will be empty and used to push the new guess into it
we also create a play method which uses the getguess method to prompt the user to enter a number using a condition(while loop)
the new number entered will then be added to the prevguesses variable
after every guess or entry a message will appear saying if the guess is too low, too high or correct with the number of guesses that have been entered
as soon the correct number is matched the game will end
